                            <p>It is extremely rare that we have to cancel confirmed bookings. We always try to avoid cancelling, but we must reserve the right to do so. We shall not cancel your confirmed holiday less than 60 days before departure unless we are forced to do so as a result of unusual and unforeseeable conditions beyond our control, the consequences of which we could not have avoided even with all due care.</p>
                            <p>If we cancel your tour (except where you have failed to make payment or as a result of force majeure) we shall offer you the choice of purchasing an alternative tour from us of a similar standard to that originally booked if available, in the same period. If the chosen alternative is less expensive than your original tour, we shall refund the difference. If it is more expensive, we shall ask you to pay the difference. Alternatively, you are entitled to a full refund of all monies you have paid to us. We are not able to pay any expenses and losses incurred as a result of any cancellation.</p>

                            <p>We regret we cannot compensate where the proper performance of our duty is affected by any incident which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, anticipate or avoid. Such events may include war, terrorist activity, unexpected government acts, riots, civil strife, natural disaster, border closures, industrial disputes, fire, road closures, pilferage, epidemics, quarantines, land and air travel, extreme weather conditions and other similar incidents beyond our capability to manage.</p>

The client acknowledges their understanding that the route, schedules, timings, accommodations, itineraries, amenities and mode of transport may be subject to change without prior notice due to circumstances or events, which may include sickness or mechanical breakdown, incidents in the location where the tour will be operated, flight cancellations, strikes, events emanating from political disputes, entry or border difficulties, extreme weather and other unpredictable or unforeseeable circumstances which are beyond the reasonable control of Deep Africa and that Deep Africa is not liable to any client for such changes or amendments.</p>
